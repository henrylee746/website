      <h4>Inspiration</h4>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Team Metrics Dashboard project. This was a personal
        project originated from my internship at Ericsson Canada, tasked with
        designing a web application to scrape performance metrics of employees
        off of pushed code commits using the Gerrit REST API.
      </p>
      <h4> Extension of the project</h4>
      <p>
        Currently, this project does not contain any real information anymore,
        and everything is scraped off a Supabase PostgreSQL mock dataset. The
        dataset is relatively small, containing only two mock "employees" and
        two "commit subjects" - each employee/subject containing a set of
        commits worked on with code churn numbers.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Code Churn?</h4>
      <p>
        Code Churn (a.k.a. Code Rework) is the phenomenon where someone
        rewrites/deletes lines of code shortly after it was wrote. This is
        common in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and is a good
        metric to measure a developer's productivity/blockers, depending on the
        context.
      </p>
      <TypographyBlockquote
        content=" Low churn could mean slow productivity but also a lack of
        needing to refactor due to clear requirements, high-quality code, and
        passing of unit tests on the first trial. High code churn could mean
        high productivity if there is a large feature being worked
        on/function(s) constantly being optimized, but also an issue with
        testing/unclear user requirements if the same blocks of code are
        consistently being changed"
